    <h3>What is a record?</h3>
    <p>
      Records are any thing on which information is recorded or stored. They can be graphic, electronic, mechanical or
      any other means, and include books, documents, maps, drawings, letters, vouchers and papers.
    </p>
    <h3>How are records stored?</h3>
    <p>
      B.C. Government records are typically stored and organized by subject, not by name. It’s important to provide the
      subject you're requesting records about so that we can help you find the right records.
