                <br/>
                <p>
                  We want to provide fast service, but we are facing some delays.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                  Delays can be due to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The volume of records requested. Requesting many years of records can cause delays and it can slow down processing time.</li>
                  <li>Many MCFD records, especially older ones, are hard copies and can take some time to digitize.</li>
                  <li>Content of the records. Some records can be of a sensitive nature and may take some time for an analyst to process them.</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <p>
                  We recently introduced a new computer system to reduce processing times, but until the system is fully implemented, there may be some delays. Please be as precise as possible to help streamline your request. Analysts are available to help you clarify what information you are looking for.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                  We know it is important to meet deadlines. We are currently addressing these issues by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Using dedicated resources to improve response times.</li>
                  <li>Modernizing policies, procedures, and software.</li>
