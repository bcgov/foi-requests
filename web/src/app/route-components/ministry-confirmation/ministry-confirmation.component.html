        Please be advised that, due to the ongoing wildfire and drought-related developments around the Province, many Ministry of Forests personnel have been deployed across the Province to support the response and recovery. While every effort will be taken by staff to manage our FOI responsibilities, our response time may be impacted during this situation.
