        destinations and resorts that meet the thresholds under the Reviewable Project Regulation of the Environmental
        Assessment Act. When a major project is proposed in British Columbia, it must undergo an Environmental
        Assessment (EA). All major projects are searchable on the Environmental Assessment Office Project Information
        Centre (EPIC) website at: <a href="https://projects.eao.gov.bc.ca/">https://projects.eao.gov.bc.ca/</a>. If your
        request does not relate to a major project and/or is not found at this website, please consider submitting to
        the Ministry of Environment or other appropriate Ministries. For more information about the EAO, you may visit
        their website at:
